Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks."}

Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience", "abstract": "Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness, leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our implementation publicly available atthis https URLto ensure full reproducibility."}

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff, where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model, initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation, now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount. Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

Previous work were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However, they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to become a standard graph data preprocessing method."}

The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process. Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental recommendation capabilities.

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \\ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \\ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \\ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance."}

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science."}

To fight the bot invasion on our online ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on (supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study, using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline; and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets.

Assaad", "title": "Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs", "abstract": "The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models (SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG). Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper, we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs. Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs."}

This capability is not well captured by standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts. Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli. We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning. Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural settings."}

However, uncertainty due to model misspecification continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO. This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target. These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain operational environments."}

We introduce AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents in fixed \"agentless\" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating verifier approaches to our benchmark.

KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object) extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given input-output examples.This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization, and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL.

We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set.

Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction.

Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data.

Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system, composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles. Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8 detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring."}

The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression."}

We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning."}

However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content, we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs. one without CAI tool.

Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser.

In health applications, generating high-quality data while maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors, synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable health research and healthcare delivery."}

Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size, sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily, context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes."}

Recent studies consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes. This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education (CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners' LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future. Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting; (2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching LLM-based help-seeking.

The newly developed LLM-based software applications become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal for average needs."}

We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware.

First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next, we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed $k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers."}

Bogdan,Uzay Macar,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy", "title": "Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?", "abstract": "Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (this http URL) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models."}

However, processing long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few seconds."}

Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery.

This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs.

To address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally, considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box setting."}

Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant (24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\\% on UC Merced and 95.99\\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification. These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus, MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount."}

Privacy extraction attacks, such as jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions. PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility in real-world applications."}

However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges, we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase, the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions, each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a 41.81\\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$ emissions dataset."}

To manage these computational and storage demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented. However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and computing site capabilities.

In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers.

Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with user-specified confidence.

This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a Hoeffding correction.

OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior.

These failure modes have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and characterizing \"conceptual blindspots\" -- concepts present in the training data but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying data-generating process."}

However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training, slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI) strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance.

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research."}

In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation."}

Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations."}

A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner.

These architectures have increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions, add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid). As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage frameworks.

Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup over the original dense attention.

However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss."}

Aditya Prakash,Bo Dai,Chao Zhang", "title": "DF2: Distribution-Free Decision-Focused Learning", "abstract": "Decision-focused learning (DFL), which differentiates through the KKT conditions, has recently emerged as a powerful approach for predict-then-optimize problems. However, under probabilistic settings, DFL faces three major bottlenecks: model mismatch error, sample average approximation error, and gradient approximation error. Model mismatch error stems from the misalignment between the model's parameterized predictive distribution and the true probability distribution. Sample average approximation error arises when using finite samples to approximate the expected optimization objective. Gradient approximation error occurs when the objectives are non-convex and KKT conditions cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we present DF2, the first distribution-free decision-focused learning method designed to mitigate these three bottlenecks. Rather than depending on a task-specific forecaster that requires precise model assumptions, our method directly learns the expected optimization function during training. To efficiently learn this function in a data-driven manner, we devise an attention-based model architecture inspired by the distribution-based parameterization of the expected objective. We evaluate DF2 on two synthetic problems and three real-world problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of DF2. Our code is available at:this https URL."}

OMI is a severe form of heart attack characterized by complete blockage of one or more coronary arteries requiring immediate referral for cardiac catheterization to restore blood flow to the heart. Two thirds of OMI cases are difficult to visually identify from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and can be potentially fatal if not identified quickly. Previous works on this topic are scarce, and current state-of-the-art evidence suggests both feature-based random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising approaches to improve ECG detection of OMI. Methods: While the ResNet architecture has been adapted for use with ECG recordings, it is not ideally suited to capture informative temporal features within each lead and the spatial concordance or discordance across leads. We propose a clinically informed modification of the ResNet-18 architecture. The model first learns temporal features through temporal convolutional layers with 1xk kernels followed by a spatial convolutional layer, after the residual blocks, with 12x1 kernels to learn spatial features. Results: ECG-SMART-NET was benchmarked against the original ResNet-18 and other state-of-the-art models on a multisite real-word clinical dataset that consists of 10,393 ECGs from 7,397 unique patients (rate of OMI =7.2%). ECG-SMART-NET outperformed other models in the classification of OMI with a test AUC of 0.953 [0.921, 0.978]. Conclusion and Significance: ECG-SMART-NET can outperform the state-of-the-art random forest for OMI prediction and is better suited for this task than the original ResNet-18 architecture."}

One prominent attempt to address this issue is enhancing DNN verifiers with the capability of producing certificates of their results that are subject to independent algorithmic checking. While formulations of Marabou certificate checking already exist on top of the state-of-the-art DNN verifier Marabou, they are implemented in C++, and that code itself raises the question of trust (e.g., in the precision of floating point calculations or guarantees for implementation soundness). Here, we present an alternative implementation of the Marabou certificate checking in Imandra -- an industrial functional programming language and an interactive theorem prover (ITP) -- that allows us to obtain full proof of certificate correctness. The significance of the result is two-fold. Firstly, it gives stronger independent guarantees for Marabou proofs. Secondly, it opens the way for the wider adoption of DNN verifiers in interactive theorem proving in the same way as many ITPs already incorporate SMT solvers."}

Our method first employs an unlearning phase, in which the network's loss is intentionally maximized on a small clean dataset to expose neurons that are excessively sensitive to backdoor triggers. Subsequently, in the relearning phase, these suspicious neurons are recalibrated using targeted reinitialization and cosine similarity regularization, effectively neutralizing backdoor influences while preserving the model's performance on benign data. Extensive experiments with 12 backdoor types on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB, and Tiny-ImageNet) and architectures (PreAct-ResNet18, VGG19-BN, and ViT-B-16) demonstrate that ULRL significantly reduces the attack success rate without compromising clean accuracy -- even when only 1% of clean data is used for defense."}

Instead, we introduce a novel ternary text classification scheme, adding an \"undecided\" category for texts that could be attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial to understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users. This research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining machine-generated texts, emphasizing need for detectors to provide clear and understandable explanations to users.

We constructed a new dataset of texts generated by two top-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to produce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to investigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in new ternary classification context. Our results highlight why \"undecided\" category is much needed from the viewpoint of explainability.

Unlike traditional benchmarks primarily focused on prediction accuracy, REACT emphasizes transparent and interpretable reasoning, requiring models to align their logic closely with expert-derived procedures. To assess whether LLM reasoning aligns closely with human experts, we annotated 511 clinical cases from the medical domain and 86 legal cases from the legal domain, each enriched with detailed expert-extracted rationales and evidence supporting each step of the reasoning process. These annotations were guided by carefully constructed reasoning graphs, which explicitly encode domain-specific inference structures and decision criteria derived by domain experts. These reasoning graphs serve not only as standards for expert annotation but also as structured guidelines enabling models to reason transparently and step-by-step. To address the scalability challenges of manual annotation, we further developed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline leveraging expert-defined reasoning graph templates to efficiently generate new graphs, exploring the potential to extend our approach into additional critical domains.

In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability."}

To mitigate this issue, downstream task-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi-task scenarios is not straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from replay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with naïve finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods.

Truncated Vendi Score for Finite-Sample Convergence Guarantees", "abstract": "Evaluating the diversity of generative models without reference data poses methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi and RKE scores address this by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures. Among these two, the Vendi score is typically computed via the eigendecomposition of an $n \\times n$ kernel matrix constructed from n generated samples. However, the prohibitive computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the number of samples used to fewer than 20,000. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi and RKE scores under restricted sample sizes. We numerically demonstrate that, in general, the Vendi score computed with standard sample sizes below 20,000 may not converge to its asymptotic value under infinite sampling. To address this, we introduce the $t$-truncated Vendi score by truncating the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix, which is provably guaranteed to converge to its population limit with $n=\\mathcal{O}(t)$ samples. We further show that existing Nyström and FKEA approximation methods converge to the asymptotic limit of the truncated Vendi score. In contrast to the Vendi score, we prove that the RKE score enjoys universal convergence guarantees across all kernel functions. We conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of Nyström and FKEA computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi score, and we analyze how the truncated Vendi and RKE scores correlate with the diversity of image and text data.

By integrating renewable energy sources, they enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. However, ensuring their availability and security requires advanced operational control and safety measures. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning can help assess grid stability, challenges such as data scarcity and cybersecurity threats, particularly adversarial attacks, remain. Data scarcity is a major issue, as obtaining real-world instances of grid instability requires significant expertise, resources, and time. Yet, these instances are critical for testing new research advancements and security mitigations. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting instability in smart grids using only stable data. It employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the generator is designed not to produce near-realistic data but instead to generate Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples with respect to the stable class. These OOD samples represent unstable behavior, anomalies, or disturbances that deviate from the stable data distribution. By training exclusively on stable data and exposing the discriminator to OOD samples, our framework learns a robust decision boundary to distinguish stable conditions from any unstable behavior, without requiring unstable data during training. Furthermore, we incorporate an adversarial training layer to enhance resilience against attacks. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, our solution achieves up to 98.1\\% accuracy in predicting grid stability and 98.9\\% in detecting adversarial attacks. Implemented on a single-board computer, it enables real-time decision-making with an average response time of under 7ms."}

Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence.

We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively.

However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education."}

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%).

We show in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\\alpha$-entmax can avoid these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows $\\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense (softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.

The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88% voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a 92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an 82% cache hit rate for memory access."}

We evaluate various forms of musical attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models' ability to understand and identify harmful memes.

Existing studies treat memorization and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains, which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness.

Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations", "abstract": "Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single \"canonical\" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4% of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and 90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance, finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall, our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization at inference time to boost performance."}

Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser.

In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35). Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to internalize and reflect human moral reasoning."}

To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions.

We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets.

Despite their differences in workflows, existing LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.

The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated dialogues.To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200 randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when creating each augmented turn in the previous step.Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems."}

This article provides a comprehensive review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge, and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive and theory-aligned."}

Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs", "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs, we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than smaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading effective supervision."}

Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score (AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision (FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI, SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B, with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of 4.73."}

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods: We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO (n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8 change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available, expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases, potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis."}

MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy."}

Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel, CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to 1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42% relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive representations.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff, where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model, initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation, now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount. Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

While using multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with a router.

However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (this http URL) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning.

Consequently, most existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances. To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets.

We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution, inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on diverse task distributions."}

We introduce \\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement.

OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead.

This means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step, and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching. In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional GPU throughput.

The key challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity, offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others; linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects. To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy, which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic coverage.

While such benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?) and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?). In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics -- a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency -- into LLM benchmarking. We make four primary contributions. First, we reflect on current LLM benchmark developments and contrast them with psychometrics-based test development. Second, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for {P}sychometrics-{A}ssis{T}ed ben{CH}marking of LLMs. PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations.

The task of distinguishing LLM-authored texts is complicated by the nuanced and overlapping behaviors of both machines and humans. In this paper, we challenge the current practice of considering LLM-generated text detection a binary classification task of differentiating human from AI. Instead, we introduce a novel ternary text classification scheme, adding an \"undecided\" category for texts that could be attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial to understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users. This research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining machine-generated texts, emphasizing need for detectors to provide clear and understandable explanations to users. Our study involves creating four new datasets comprised of texts from various LLMs and human authors. Based on new datasets, we performed binary classification tests to ascertain the most effective SOTA detection methods and identified SOTA LLMs capable of producing harder-to-detect texts. We constructed a new dataset of texts generated by two top-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to produce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to investigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in new ternary classification context. Our results highlight why \"undecided\" category is much needed from the viewpoint of explainability. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of explainability of the three best-performing detectors and the explanation notes of the human annotators, revealing insights about the complexity of explainable detection of machine-generated texts.

Our approach uses character-level segmentation to identify meaningful subword units, facilitating more accurate and context-aware translation. To enable this, we utilize a Character-level Transformer model for Sanskrit Word Segmentation (CharSS), which addresses the complexities of sandhi and morpho-phonemic changes during segmentation. We observe consistent improvements in two experimental settings for technical term translation using Sanskrit-derived segments, averaging 8.46 and 6.79 chrF++ scores, respectively.

To assess whether LLM reasoning aligns closely with human experts, we annotated 511 clinical cases from the medical domain and 86 legal cases from the legal domain, each enriched with detailed expert-extracted rationales and evidence supporting each step of the reasoning process. These annotations were guided by carefully constructed reasoning graphs, which explicitly encode domain-specific inference structures and decision criteria derived by domain experts. These reasoning graphs serve not only as standards for expert annotation but also as structured guidelines enabling models to reason transparently and step-by-step. To address the scalability challenges of manual annotation, we further developed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline leveraging expert-defined reasoning graph templates to efficiently generate new graphs, exploring the potential to extend our approach into additional critical domains.

This offers a more robust path towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning."}

Martins", "title": "Long-Context Generalization with Sparse Attention", "abstract": "Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\\alpha$-entmax can avoid these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows $\\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense (softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods. By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax, scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\\alpha$-entmax baselines on long-context generalization."}

Current evaluation approaches often rely on isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies: the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics.

These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment methods.

From that moment on, users engage much more with one another; their communication is also more emotional and polarised. While it has been difficult to grasp such moments with computational methods, we suggest that trigger points are a useful concept to understand and ultimately model such behaviour. Established in qualitative focus group interviews to understand political polarisation (Mau, Lux, and Westheuser 2023), trigger points represent moments when individuals feel that their understanding of what is fair, normal, or appropriate in society is questioned. In the original studies, individuals show strong and negative emotional responses when certain triggering words or topics are mentioned. Our paper finds that these trigger points also exist in online debates. We examine online deliberations on Reddit between 2020 and 2022 and collect >100 million comments from subreddits related to a set of words identified as trigger points in UK politics. Analysing the comments, we find that trigger words increase user engagement and animosity, i.e., more negativity, hate speech, and controversial comments. Introducing trigger points to computational studies of online communication, our findings are relevant to researchers interested in affective computing, online deliberation, and how citizens debate politics and society in light of affective polarisation."}

However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression."}

Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning."}

Previous research suffers from the problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing. Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6 parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera. Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation, making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets.

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement.

To address these problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF) module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns."}

Gradient integration is a building block in the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a building block often combines with other information from visual models such as activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout all experimental models."}

Even though model weights are hidden to protect the intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks, the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing approach termed QueryWise.

Editing models, on the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions such as weather and time of day.

Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning.

This ensures that only relevant information is utilized in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions. Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

By selecting the well-established DINOv2 method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and little methodological adaptation.

Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\\% accuracy improvement over existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in attention computation and 40\\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising accuracy from 23.26\\% to 61.03\\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving."}

Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images), DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2 images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58, and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90, and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets, DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance prediction and landcover segmentation).

Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound.

These approaches do not explicitly account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling. Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.

In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers.

To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features.

While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose.

Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and interpretation of a single category.

This allows the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning. This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the information association between the prototype and the training image patches while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification performance.

In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently.

These architectures have increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions, add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid). As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under the same training compute.

We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.

The key challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity, offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others; linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects. To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy, which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely used benchmarks.

MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models' ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks."}

In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.

Registration is a challenging problem for deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings, it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a highly dynamic organ such as the heart.In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric, strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent."}

Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels. Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities. Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI. The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a comprehensive displacement vector field.

Complemented by spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF across species.

In contrast, the human AF exhibits greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing unique to humans.

In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work."}

Two main strategies for this have emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space) and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and enhanced risk prediction accuracy.

While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs.

Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as disconnections or unnatural curvatures.

While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a state-of-the-art SSL method.SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models, achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64.

In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data.

Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying data-generating process."}

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

Kevin Zhou", "title": "NeRF-based CBCT Reconstruction needs Normalization and Initialization", "abstract": "Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging. However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training, slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI) strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets, covering 7 distinct anatomical regions."}

This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent. Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\\% for pituitary gland and 4.60--96.41\\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported 80.00--92.10\\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\\% for adenoma segmentation. Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in small structures like the normal pituitary gland.

We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2) multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with 70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO.

In this work, we propose a new progressive cross-stream cooperation (PCSC) framework that improves all three tasks above. The basic idea is to utilize both spatial region (resp., temporal segment proposals) and features from one stream (i.e., the Flow/RGB stream) to help another stream (i.e., the RGB/Flow stream) to iteratively generate better bounding boxes in the spatial domain (resp., temporal segments in the temporal domain). In this way, not only the actions could be more accurately localized both spatially and temporally, but also the action classes could be predicted more precisely. Specifically, we first combine the latest region proposals (for spatial detection) or segment proposals (for temporal localization) from both streams to form a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection or segment detection models. Second, to learn better representations, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another stream, which also leads to better action detection and segment detection models. By first using our newly proposed PCSC framework for spatial localization at the frame-level and then applying our temporal PCSC framework for temporal localization at the tube-level, the action localization results are progressively improved at both the frame level and the video level. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approaches for spatio-temporal action localization in realistic scenarios."}

Alternatively, learning fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g., species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution.

The bottleneck lies in that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding, while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation.

MagicPose4D comprises two key modules: (i) Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module, which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but geometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton constraints. The second phase extracts the 3D motion (skeleton poses) using more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the first phase and introduces kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure physical plausibility.

BrainSAIL leverages recent advances in large-scale artificial neural networks, using them to provide insights into the functional topology of the brain. To overcome the challenge presented by the co-occurrence of multiple categories in natural images, BrainSAIL exploits semantically consistent, dense spatial features from pre-trained vision models, building upon their demonstrated ability to robustly predict neural activity. This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings without requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising process that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random augmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual features and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we enable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex. This provides a powerful tool for dissecting the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic visual processing for natural images. We validate BrainSAIL on cortical regions with known category selectivity, demonstrating its ability to accurately localize and disentangle selectivity to diverse visual concepts. Next, we demonstrate BrainSAIL's ability to characterize high-level visual selectivity to scene properties and low-level visual features such as depth, luminance, and saturation, providing insights into the encoding of complex visual information. Finally, we use BrainSAIL to directly compare the feature selectivity of different brain encoding models across different regions of interest in visual cortex. Our innovative method paves the way for significant advances in mapping and decomposing high-level visual representations in the human brain."}

While recent advances have enhanced generation quality, they have also increased sampling time, thereby limiting scalability in real-world applications. We investigate the generative sampling process of diffusion-based inpainting models and observe that these models make minimal use of the input condition during the initial sampling steps. As a result, the sampling trajectory deviates from the data manifold, requiring complex synchronization mechanisms to realign the generation process. To address this, we propose Time-aware Diffusion Paint (TD-Paint), a novel approach that adapts the diffusion process by modeling variable noise levels at the pixel level. This technique allows the model to efficiently use known pixel values from the start, guiding the generation process toward the target manifold. By embedding this information early in the diffusion process, TD-Paint significantly accelerates sampling without compromising image quality. Unlike conventional diffusion-based inpainting models, which require a dedicated architecture or an expensive generation loop, TD-Paint achieves faster sampling times without architectural modifications. Experimental results across three datasets show that TD-Paint outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models while maintaining lower complexity."}

Current methods typically represent the spatial movement of target objects with 2D trajectories, which often fail to capture user intention and frequently produce unnatural results. To enhance control, we present ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free object control approach that uses a 3D trajectory, extended from a 2D trajectory with depth information, as a control signal. By modeling object movement as camera movement, ObjCtrl-2.5D represents the 3D trajectory as a sequence of camera poses, enabling object motion control using an existing camera motion control I2V generation model (CMC-I2V) without training. To adapt the CMC-I2V model originally designed for global motion control to handle local object motion, we introduce a module to isolate the target object from the background, enabling independent local control. In addition, we devise an effective way to achieve more accurate object control by sharing low-frequency warped latent within the object's region across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D significantly improves object control accuracy compared to training-free methods and offers more diverse control capabilities than training-based approaches using 2D trajectories, enabling complex effects like object rotation.

In this paper, we argue that the static FR strategy, predominantly adopted in prior literature for evaluating AFR efficacy, cannot faithfully characterize the actual capabilities of determined trackers who aim to track a specific target identity. In particular, we introduce DynTracker, a dynamic FR strategy where the model's gallery database is iteratively updated with newly recognized target identity images. Surprisingly, such a simple approach renders all the existing AFR protections ineffective. To mitigate the privacy threats posed by DynTracker, we advocate for explicitly promoting diversity in the AFR-protected images. We hypothesize that the lack of diversity is the primary cause of the failure of existing AFR methods. Specifically, we develop DivTrackee, a novel method for crafting diverse AFR protections that builds upon a text-guided image generation framework and diversity-promoting adversarial losses. Through comprehensive experiments on various image benchmarks and feature extractors, we demonstrate DynTracker's strength in breaking existing AFR methods and the superiority of DivTrackee in preventing user facial images from being identified by dynamic FR strategies.

While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. %, our approach generates robust and invariant features across diverse and unknown modalities. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR).

However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30).

We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios."}

Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions. Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52% at overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be publicly available atthis https URL."}

In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and modality-rich mathematical problem settings.

Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features, refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model.

Our approach preserves background regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture. To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws from the appropriate source.

Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods. To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup.

Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process.

Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases."}

Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained only on healthy data.

Chauhan", "title": "Improved and Explainable Cervical Cancer Classification using Ensemble Pooling of Block Fused Descriptors", "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and causes high death rates. Earlier models for detecting cervical cancer had limited success. In this work, we propose new models that substantially outperform previous models.Previous studies show that pretrained ResNets extract features from cervical cancer images well. Hence, our first model involves working with three ResNets (50, 101, 152). All the existing works use only the last convolution block of their respective ResNet, which captures abstract features (e.g., shapes, objects). However, we believe that detailed features (e.g., color, edges, texture), coming from earlier convolution blocks, are equally important for cancer (specifically cervical cancer) classification. Since now the number of features become large, we use a novel feature selection technique of Global Max Pooling for detailed features and Global Average Pooling for abstract features. Hence, our second model consists of the resulting Cascaded Block Fused variants of the three ResNets. To improve the performance further, we combine and normalize the features of the three standard ResNets as well as our proposed three Cascaded Block Fused ResNets. This type of combination is also new in cancer classification domain (also in cervical cancer), and results in our third and fourth models, respectively. We use a linear SVM for classification.We exhaustively perform experiments on two public datasets, IARC and AnnoCerv, achieving an average performance of 97.92% and 92.97% surpassing standard ResNets performance of 90.89% and 87.97%, respectively. We outperform the competitive approach available on IARC dataset with an average gain of 13.20%, while no prior competitive work available on AnnoCerv. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the cancerous region in 97% of cases."}

Conventional methods often retain redundant information or miss critical data by relying on fixed sampling intervals or operating in 3-D space instead of the descriptor feature space. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of sample space and propose a novel keyframe sampling approach for LiDAR-based place recognition. Our method minimizes redundancy while preserving essential information in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space, supporting both learning-based and handcrafted descriptors. The proposed approach incorporates a sliding window optimization strategy to ensure efficient keyframe selection and real-time performance, enabling seamless integration into robotic pipelines.

The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance.

Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel, CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to 1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42% relative to other scaling strategies.

Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar domains."}

Causal fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors, synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real data.

However, in the natural sciences, a desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences."}

The study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively, rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm: we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous.

First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next, we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering.

However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (this http URL) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models."}

We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then, using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.

It proposes a detection method based on federated contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space. Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing complex anomalies in distributed environments.

Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance -- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter and avoid reward hacking.

However, the computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead, this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to predict the extreme operating condition of the system.

This study addresses the challenge of alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022) revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%. Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting and support evidence-based policymaking."}

In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in low-dimensional space.

We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution, inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on diverse task distributions."}

To address this, we propose a novel method called Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna.

Although useful, this assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being restricted to single types for each variable.

FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered graph of real nodes.

Current limited research on MU attacks requires access to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result, our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities."}

One measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger. Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables. However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms."}

As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases, overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further mitigation strategies should be studied."}

During training phase, the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions, each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts.

However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions.

Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones.

The learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were unseen during training.

Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is, expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods.

Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy. Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks."}

Such reliance on irrelevant features, often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant. These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training. Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include natural language processing tasks.

This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a Hoeffding correction.

Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme, ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83% over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up to 8.83x.

While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment.

Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored."}

Although highly effective in practice, the underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically, low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG, establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance."}

The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably, DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and efficient data representation strategy.

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

However, RLHF is often computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss. However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment settings.In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation.

Our four artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as GPT in a brute force approach.

This means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step, and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching. In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically.

A model's construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data. We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups, particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical model-building problems in the future."}

Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012. However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to provide further research directions for future ADA researchers."}

Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance.

Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff, where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model, initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation, now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount. Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects.

A key question is when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\\ell^2$ norm. For intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points. This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples, motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case, confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points."}

Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs."}

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient, truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret."}

It is a method that primarily utilizes machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects. This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments. Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment."}

Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware.

Registration is a challenging problem for deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings, it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a highly dynamic organ such as the heart.In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric, strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent."}

Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network (BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or data-driven methods for power electronics simulations."}

While existing privacy research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions. Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques.

Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a baseline for future research.

This paper introduces a novel framework based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable, parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model (CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states, particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation. Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states. Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation in realistic CV quantum systems."}

We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis (qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines.

Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds, temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model.

Unlike traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity. Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up to 40$\\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\\times$ lower complexity, demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications."}

We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation.

We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format.

The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware.

Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations.

In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present.

Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\\% accuracy improvement over existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in attention computation and 40\\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising accuracy from 23.26\\% to 61.03\\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving."}

We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO structures under a unified API.

Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries."}

Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations."}

Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work, we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a training image is available as a public feature.

Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup over the original dense attention.

Sample average approximation error arises when using finite samples to approximate the expected optimization objective. Gradient approximation error occurs when the objectives are non-convex and KKT conditions cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we present DF2, the first distribution-free decision-focused learning method designed to mitigate these three bottlenecks. Rather than depending on a task-specific forecaster that requires precise model assumptions, our method directly learns the expected optimization function during training.

They provide unique insight into disease biology and staging systems with individual-level clinical utility. Discrete models consider disease progression as a latent permutation of events, where each event corresponds to a feature becoming measurably abnormal. However, permutation inference using traditional maximum likelihood approaches becomes prohibitive due to combinatoric explosion, severely limiting model dimensionality and utility. Here we leverage ideas from optimal transport to model disease progression as a latent permutation matrix of events belonging to the Birkhoff polytope, facilitating fast inference via optimisation of the variational lower bound. This enables a factor of 1000 times faster inference than the current state of the art and, correspondingly, supports models with several orders of magnitude more features than the current state of the art can consider. Experiments demonstrate the increase in speed, accuracy and robustness to noise in simulation. Further experiments with real-world imaging data from two separate datasets, one from Alzheimer's disease patients, the other age-related macular degeneration, showcase, for the first time, pixel-level disease progression events in the brain and eye, respectively. Our method is low compute, interpretable and applicable to any progressive condition and data modality, giving it broad potential clinical utility."}

While efficient, quantization inevitably degrades model quality, especially in aggressive low-bit settings such as 3-bit and 4-bit precision. In this paper, we propose DecDEC, an inference scheme that improves the quality of low-bit LLMs while preserving the key benefits of quantization: GPU memory savings and latency reduction. DecDEC stores the residual matrix -- the difference between full-precision and quantized weights -- in CPU, and dynamically fetches the residuals for only a small portion of the weights. This portion corresponds to the salient channels, marked by activation outliers, with the fetched residuals helping to correct quantization errors in these channels. Salient channels are identified dynamically at each decoding step by analyzing the input activations -- this enables adaptation to the dynamic nature of activation distribution, thus maximizing the effectiveness of error compensation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecDEC by augmenting state-of-the-art quantization methods. For example, DecDEC reduces the perplexity of a 3-bit Llama-3-8B-Instruct model from 10.15 to 9.12 -- outperforming its 3.5-bit counterpart -- while adding less than 0.0003\\% to GPU memory usage and incurring only a 1.7\\% inference slowdown on NVIDIA RTX 4050 Mobile."}

Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. We demonstrate the transferability of the approach to other datasets, architectures, optimizers and even tasks (regression instead of classification).

However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach.

However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor, lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when some rewards are never observable."}

Alternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training, storing, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of models grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight averaging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does not fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling diversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable devices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However, generating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations that are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel stochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for filtering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant representations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The student representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide the distillation process.

At the same time, pre-trained Language Models (LMs) have taken the world by storm and for good reason. They exhibit remarkable emergent abilities and are readily adapted to downstream tasks. This opens one of the most exciting frontiers in FL: fine-tuning LMs. Yet, a persistent challenge in FL is the frequent, rigid communication of parameters -- a problem magnified by the sheer size of these contemporary models. The FedOpt family of algorithms has become the go-to approach for FL, relying on fixed but arbitrary intervals for model exchanges. Recently, the FDA algorithm prescribed a dynamic approach by monitoring the training progress. However, it introduced a hard-to-calibrate parameter and imposed a rigid synchronization scheme. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing the FDA-Opt family of algorithms -- a unified generalization of both FDA and FedOpt. Our experimental evaluation focuses on fine-tuning LMs on downstream NLP tasks and demonstrates that FDA-Opt outperforms FedOpt even when it is configured with hyper-parameters specifically optimized for the latter. In other words, we show that FDA-Opt is a practical, drop-in replacement for FedOpt in modern FL libraries and systems: it requires no additional configuration and delivers superior performance out of the box."}

To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al. (2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising performance."}

Our analysis reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally adaptable solving strategy.

We propose a novel approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction.

Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains.

Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration.

Hence, physicians and researchers have relied on simple box-constraints, ignoring important anatomical factors. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn realistic anatomically constrained upper-limb range of motion (RoM) boundaries from motion capture data. This is achieved by fitting a one-class support vector machine to a dataset of upper-limb joint space exploration motions with an efficient hyper-parameter tuning scheme.

To overcome these issues, we propose Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution (M3D), a lightweight, non-deep transfer learning framework. M3D consists of four key modules: manifold feature transformation, dynamic distribution alignment, classifier learning, and ensemble learning. The data is mapped to an optimal Grassmann manifold space, enabling dynamic alignment of source and target domains. This alignment is designed to prioritize both marginal and conditional distributions, improving adaptation efficiency across diverse datasets. In classifier learning, the principle of structural risk minimization is applied to build robust classification models. Additionally, dynamic distribution alignment iteratively refines the classifier. The ensemble learning module aggregates classifiers from different optimization stages to leverage diversity and enhance prediction accuracy. M3D is evaluated on two EEG emotion recognition datasets using two validation protocols (cross-subject single-session and cross-subject cross-session) and a clinical EEG dataset for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

Hence, our first model involves working with three ResNets (50, 101, 152). All the existing works use only the last convolution block of their respective ResNet, which captures abstract features (e.g., shapes, objects). However, we believe that detailed features (e.g., color, edges, texture), coming from earlier convolution blocks, are equally important for cancer (specifically cervical cancer) classification. Since now the number of features become large, we use a novel feature selection technique of Global Max Pooling for detailed features and Global Average Pooling for abstract features. Hence, our second model consists of the resulting Cascaded Block Fused variants of the three ResNets. To improve the performance further, we combine and normalize the features of the three standard ResNets as well as our proposed three Cascaded Block Fused ResNets.

Previous works on this topic are scarce, and current state-of-the-art evidence suggests both feature-based random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising approaches to improve ECG detection of OMI. Methods: While the ResNet architecture has been adapted for use with ECG recordings, it is not ideally suited to capture informative temporal features within each lead and the spatial concordance or discordance across leads. We propose a clinically informed modification of the ResNet-18 architecture.

However, the prohibitive computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the number of samples used to fewer than 20,000. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi and RKE scores under restricted sample sizes. We numerically demonstrate that, in general, the Vendi score computed with standard sample sizes below 20,000 may not converge to its asymptotic value under infinite sampling. To address this, we introduce the $t$-truncated Vendi score by truncating the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix, which is provably guaranteed to converge to its population limit with $n=\\mathcal{O}(t)$ samples. We further show that existing Nyström and FKEA approximation methods converge to the asymptotic limit of the truncated Vendi score. In contrast to the Vendi score, we prove that the RKE score enjoys universal convergence guarantees across all kernel functions. We conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of Nyström and FKEA computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi score, and we analyze how the truncated Vendi and RKE scores correlate with the diversity of image and text data.

These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications leading to a loss of guarantees and poor performance in practice. Recent work has shown that, in the bivariate case, Bayesian model selection can greatly improve performance by exchanging restrictive modelling for more flexible assumptions, at the cost of a small probability of making an error. Our work shows that this approach is useful in the important multivariate case as well. We propose a scalable algorithm leveraging a continuous relaxation of the discrete model selection problem. Specifically, we employ the Causal Gaussian Process Conditional Density Estimator (CGP-CDE) as a Bayesian non-parametric model, using its hyperparameters to construct an adjacency matrix. This matrix is then optimised using the marginal likelihood and an acyclicity regulariser, giving the maximum a posteriori causal graph. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach, showing it is advantageous to perform multivariate causal discovery without infeasible assumptions using Bayesian model selection."}

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations -- made tractable by the RBM's structure -- we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation.

By integrating renewable energy sources, they enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. However, ensuring their availability and security requires advanced operational control and safety measures. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning can help assess grid stability, challenges such as data scarcity and cybersecurity threats, particularly adversarial attacks, remain. Data scarcity is a major issue, as obtaining real-world instances of grid instability requires significant expertise, resources, and time. Yet, these instances are critical for testing new research advancements and security mitigations. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting instability in smart grids using only stable data. It employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the generator is designed not to produce near-realistic data but instead to generate Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples with respect to the stable class. These OOD samples represent unstable behavior, anomalies, or disturbances that deviate from the stable data distribution. By training exclusively on stable data and exposing the discriminator to OOD samples, our framework learns a robust decision boundary to distinguish stable conditions from any unstable behavior, without requiring unstable data during training. Furthermore, we incorporate an adversarial training layer to enhance resilience against attacks. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, our solution achieves up to 98.1\\% accuracy in predicting grid stability and 98.9\\% in detecting adversarial attacks. Implemented on a single-board computer, it enables real-time decision-making with an average response time of under 7ms."}

The key insight is to couple the sampling process of interest with an idealized comparison process that has an explicit Gaussian-convolution structure. We then leverage simple identities from information theory, including the I-MMSE relationship, to bound the discrepancy (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two discrete-time processes. In particular, we show that, if the diffusion step sizes are chosen sufficiently small and one can approximate certain conditional mean estimators well, then the sampling distribution is provably close to the target distribution.

However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30).

In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2 demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future."}

Briand,Ruiyuan Wan,Ruifeng Gao", "title": "Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation", "abstract": "Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3)."}

However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and visualization of their path profiles."}

However, we find that function call graphs (FCGs) vary a lot when using different compilation settings, especially with diverse function inlining decisions.In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study on the variance of FCGs compiled by various compilation settings and explore its effect on binary decomposition methods. We first construct a dataset compiled by 17 compilers, using 6 optimizations to 4 architectures and analyze the changes and mappings of the FCGs. We find that the size of FCGs changes dramatically, while the FCGs are still linked by three different kinds of mappings. Then we evaluate the existing works under the FCG variance, and results show that existing works are facing great challenges when conducting cross-compiler evaluation with diverse optimization settings.

Converting RegExes for Log Parsing into Dynatrace Pattern Language", "abstract": "Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However, users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone.

While Agile methodologies dominate contemporary software design practices, the Waterfall Model persists, particularly, within hybrid approaches that fuse structured, sequential workflows with the adaptability of agile practices. Despite its continued presence, little attention has been given to how the Waterfall Model is simulated in research contexts. A structured search of major academic databases identified 68 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. After applying inclusion criteria, selected studies were analyzed across four dimensions: (1) simulation methodologies (e.g., discrete-event simulation, system dynamics), (2) platforms and tools (e.g.,this http URL, SimPy), (3) geographic and temporal trends, and (4) fidelity to Royce's original seven-phase model. Discrete-event simulation was most commonly used, reflecting the model's sequential nature. Early work relied on proprietary platforms, while recent studies increasingly use open-source, Python-based tools. No studies fully implemented Royce's original formulation, most employed adaptations. These findings suggest that although niche, simulation of the Waterfall Model is present in academic discourse.

Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.

Traditional approaches to address these challenges involve retraining, a resource-intensive process that demands significant investments in data labeling, model updates, and redeployment. This research introduces an adaptive, on-the-fly input refinement framework aimed at improving model performance through input validation and transformation. The input validation component detects inputs likely to cause errors, while input transformation applies domain-specific adjustments to better align these inputs with the model's handling capabilities. This dual strategy reduces mispredictions across various domains, boosting model performance without necessitating retraining.

However, such crucial information is usually unavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly extracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive, patches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that over 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply ignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming noises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code.

The framework operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i) accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii) 98\\% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem growth. This work establishes active tool discovery as a fundamental design pattern for scalable autonomous agent systems."}

We present cuVSLAM, a state-of-the-art solution for visual simultaneous localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of cuVSLAM."}
